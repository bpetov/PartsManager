# PartsManager

Here I will describe more about my project (functionallity, purpose, etc.)

##Purpose

Parts manager is app which will helps you with the organization of the available parts in your company. Parts manager is basic software (resembling an ERP system). The app allows us to have control and to manage our available parts. It shows us the parts and we can search for a specific number from different part. The software has a check button that when pressing it displays you top three reference with minimum inventory level. Also we can edit function which includes add, remove and refresh options. The add option is for adding a new part in the inventory. Remove оптион is for removing a part but we have to search for the exact id number that matches the same part which we want to remove from the inventory. Refresh option is to update the available parts.
